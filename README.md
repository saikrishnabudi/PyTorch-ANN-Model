# PyTorch-ANN-Model

PyTorch Library on Artificial Neural Network Model.

Here i have taken the PyTorch library from Python which is developer by Facebook.

Here i applied the Artificial Neural Network model on the Indian Diabetes datasetby using PyTorch Libray.

From 0 to 49 it will gives us the Accuracy.

Experimenting with Learning Rates from 0.0001 to 0.01 or 0.001.

We can incresing the Accuracy by Tuning for Hyperparameters (Learning Rate).

For every Epoch we will get the results
